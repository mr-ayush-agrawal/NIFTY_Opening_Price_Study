# Index Relating

In this project, I apply the knowledge gained from the Coursera course [Python and Statistics For Financial Analysis](#).

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Focus

The primary objective of this project is to establish a relationship between various market indices and **NIFTY50**. We will create a Linear Regression Model to predict changes in the Nifty Price using data from other stock markets.

## :open_file_folder: Data

The 'Indices' folder contains data for different stock market indices, which are used in this project for modeling and analysis. Each file includes information on the opening, closing, high, low, adjusted close, and volume for the respective markets.

Please note that the data available spans from ***2008-01-02*** to ***2018-08-21***.

### :warning: Caution

**Important Note:** The data used in this project is not current due to limitations in data availability on [Yahoo Finance](#). As an alternative, I sourced the data from another provider that offered this historical data.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key sections:

- **Data Preprocessing:** The 'Preprocessing' phase involved cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In the 'EDA' section, we conducted various visualizations and correlation analyses to understand the data better.

- **Modeling:** This section includes the development and evaluation of prediction models, including Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Generalized Least Squares (GLS), and additional models.

- **Trading Strategy:** We explored different trading strategies and evaluated their performance compared to a buy-and-hold strategy.

- **Results:** Summarize the insights and findings from the project's analyses and modeling.
